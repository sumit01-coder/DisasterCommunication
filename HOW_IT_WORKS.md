# How Disaster Comm Works in Real Life

## 1. The Scenario
Imagine a major disaster (earthquake, flood, or hurricane) strikes. 
- **Cell Towers are down**: You have no signal bars on your phone.
- **Internet is cutoff**: WhatsApp, Messenger, and Email do not work.
- **Power is out**: Wi-Fi routers at home are dead.

Usually, your smartphone becomes a "dumb phone" in this situation. **Disaster Comm** turns it back into a communication tool.

## 2. The Direct Connection (P2P)
Normally, your phone sends data to a cell tower miles away. 
With **Disaster Comm**, your phone uses its internal **Bluetooth** and **Wi-Fi** radios to talk directly to other phones nearby (within ~100 meters).

- **No SIM Card Needed**: It works even if you remove your SIM.
- **No Internet Needed**: It creates its own mini-network.

## 3. The "Mesh" Network (The Magic)
The real power is the **Mesh**. 
If you want to talk to a rescue worker 500 meters away, but your range is only 100 meters, the app uses people in between as a bridge.

**Example:**
[You] <--> [Person A] <--> [Person B] <--> [Rescue Worker]

1. You send an SOS.
2. Your phone sends it to Person A (nearby).
3. Person A's phone (automatically, in the background) passes it to Person B.
4. Person B's phone passes it to the Rescue Worker.

This happens automatically. The more people having the app, the stronger and larger the network becomes.

## 4. How to Use It
1. **Install Early**: You must install the app **BEFORE** the disaster strikes (or share it via Bluetooth 'Nearby Share' if someone else has it).
2. **Open the App**: Just turn it on.
3. **Grant Permissions**: Allow Location and Bluetooth (crucial for finding neighbors).
4. **Auto-Connect**: The app will automatically find nearby phones and say "Mode: Connected".
5. **Send SOS**: Tap the big Red Button. Everyone in the mesh gets your GPS location and help message.
6. **Chat**: Use the chat feature to coordinate ("Is the bridge safe?", "We have food here").

## 5. Security & Battery
- **Encryption**: Messages are encrypted so random people can't snoop easily (in a full version).
- **Battery**: The app uses energy to scan, but in a real event, reliable information is worth the battery cost. (Future versions will have "Low Power Mode").

## Summary
It is a **digital life-line** that creates a community network out of thin air when all central infrastructure fails.
