## 🔍 How It Works

### The Magic: Mesh Networking

Traditional communication requires a central server or cell tower. DisasterComm creates a **decentralized mesh** where every device is both a client and a relay.

#### Simple Scenario (Direct Connection)

```
[Your Phone] ←→ [Friend's Phone]
Distance: ~100 meters (WiFi Direct)
```

#### Mesh Scenario (Multiple Hops)

```
[You] ←→ [Person A] ←→ [Person B] ←→ [Person C] ←→ [Rescue Worker]
 50m       80m           60m           70m

Total Range: 260 meters through mesh relay!
```

### How Messages Travel

1. **You send a message**: "Need help at location X"
2. **Direct transmission**: Message sent to all devices within direct range
3. **Automatic relay**: Those devices forward it to their neighbors
4. **Hop-by-hop delivery**: Message reaches destination through multiple relays
5. **Receipt confirmation**: Sender gets delivery confirmation

### Energy Efficiency

- **Smart Discovery**: Periodic scanning to save battery
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse existing connections
- **Adaptive Power**: Reduce transmission power when not needed
- **Background Service**: Minimal CPU usage when idle

## 🌐 Quad-Layer Connection Logic

The app uses a robust **Priority Connection Algorithm** to ensure devices connect instantly and maintain the highest possible speed.

### 1. The Discovery Layer (BLE)
*   **Technology**: Bluetooth Low Energy
*   **Role**: "The Scout"
*   **Logic**:
    *   Devices continuously broadcast a lightweight **BLE Advertisement** containing a custom 128-bit Service UUID.
    *   Scanning is aggressive (<100ms latency) but battery-optimized.
    *   **Result**: Devices "see" each other within milliseconds of coming into range.

### 2. The Low-Latency Mesh (Wi-Fi Aware / NAN)
*   **Technology**: Wi-Fi Aware (Neighbor Awareness Networking)
*   **Role**: "The Grid"
*   **Logic**:
    *   Using **NAN-DAP (Discovery & Pairing)**, devices create small data clusters without establishing full P2P groups.
    *   Does not require group owner negotiation (unlike WiFi Direct).
    *   **Result**: Extremely fast small-packet updates (Perfect for Location Sharing).

    **Why Wi-Fi Aware?**
    *   Provides extremely low power consumption while maintaining discovery over Wi-Fi.

## 📡 Advanced Mesh Routing & Reliability

The application utilizes a robust suite of advanced mesh networking protocols to ensure message delivery in any environment:

### Multi-Hop Routing (AODV)
Uses the **Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)** protocol for multi-hop routing. It dynamically discovers routes between devices, allowing a message to hop across multiple intermediate devices, effectively extending the range from 100 meters to over 1 kilometer.

### Store-and-Forward Protocol
Guarantees offline delivery through the `StoreAndForwardManager`. When a recipient is unreachable, the message is safely stored in a local queue and automatically forwarded as soon as a valid route or connection becomes available.

### Automatic Relay Mode
Devices that are stationary and have sufficient battery automatically switch into a dedicated **Relay Mode** via the `RelayModeManager`. This optimizes network topology by creating stable backbone nodes that route traffic for moving users.

### Emergency Beacon Service
In critical situations where battery is extremely low, the application can switch to the `EmergencyBeaconService`. This ultra-low-power mode uses BLE to continuously broadcast an SOS signal and your location. It can operate for up to 24 hours on just 5% battery life.

### Local TCP & UDP Discovery
In scenarios where a local router exists (even without internet), `UdpDiscoveryManager` and `LocalTcpManager` provide seamless device discovery and high-speed local network communication, augmenting the peer-to-peer mesh.

### Quad-Layer Managed Flood Routing
The application utilizes a **Quad-Layer** connectivity approach:

1.  **Wi-Fi Direct (Nearby Connections)**: High-bandwidth, primary mesh layer.
2.  **Bluetooth Classic**: Reliable fallback for older devices or when Wi-Fi is busy.
3.  **Wi-Fi Aware (NAN)**: Low-power, decentralized discovery and messaging (Android 8+).
4.  **BLE Hub (ESP32)**: LoRa-based long-range relay integration (optional hardware).

### Managed Flood Algorithm
To prevent network congestion (broadcast storms), the app implements **Managed Flooding**:
*   **Echo Suppression**: When relays forward a message, they explicitly **exclude the sender** from the broadcast target list. This prevents packets from bouncing back immediately.
*   **Deduplication**: Every node tracks `seenMessageIds`. Duplicate packets are dropped instantly.
*   **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: Packets have a hop limit (default 10) to prevent infinite loops.
*   **Multi-Path**: Messages are sent simultaneously over all available transports (Wi-Fi, BT, NAN, LoRa) to maximize delivery probability.

### Communication Flow (DAP Protocol)
**NAN-DAP (Neighbor Awareness Networking - Discovery And Pairing)** allows devices to find each other without joining a common Wi-Fi AP.
1.  **Publish**: Device A publishes service `DisasterComm_NAN`.
2.  **Subscribe**: Device B subscribes to `DisasterComm_NAN`.
3.  **Discovery**: Match found! Handles exchanged.
4.  **Pairing**: Automatic `DAP_INIT` handshake establishes a session.
5.  **Messaging**: `PacketHandler` routes encrypted JSON messages over this link.app a `PeerHandle` (Temporary ID).
    5.  **Message**: Device B sends "DAP_INIT" to Device A's `PeerHandle`. No IP address needed!

### 3. The Handshake Layer (Bluetooth Classic)
*   **Technology**: RFCOMM Socket (SPP)
*   **Role**: "The Handshake"
*   **Logic**:
    *   Once a BLE/NAN signal is detected, the app extracts the MAC address.
    *   It immediately opens a standard Bluetooth Socket (insecure, to skip PIN pairing).
    *   **Result**: Basic text communication is established in <2 seconds.

### 4. The Performance Layer (WiFi Direct)
*   **Technology**: Google Nearby Connections (Strategy: P2P_CLUSTER)
*   **Role**: "The Highway"
*   **Logic**:
    *   Simultaneously with Bluetooth, the app attempts a **Nearby Connections** upgrade.
    *   Uses high-bandwidth WiFi 5GHz where available.
    *   **Result**: Connection upgraded to >50Mbps. Enables image sharing and Voice-over-Mesh.

### 🔄 Auto-Switching Algorithm
The `MeshNetworkManager` constantly evaluates the link quality:
*   **If WiFi fails**: Seamlessly downgrade to Bluetooth without data loss.
*   **If WiFi returns**: Automatically upgrade back to WiFi Direct.
*   **If both fail**: Store messages in `Room` database and retry delivery every 30 seconds.

## 🌐 Mesh Networking

### How Mesh Extends Communication Distance

#### Single Hop (Direct)
**Range**: ~100 meters (WiFi Direct)

```
[You] ←──────→ [Friend]
     100m max
```

#### Two Hops (One Relay)
**Range**: ~200 meters

```
[You] ←──────→ [Relay] ←──────→ [Friend]
     100m               100m

Total: 200m
```

#### Multiple Hops (Full Mesh)
**Range**: Unlimited (theoretically)

```
[You] ← 80m → [A] ← 90m → [B] ← 70m → [C] ← 100m → [Destination]

Total: 340 meters
```

### Message Relay Mechanism

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Message Creation**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "msg_12345",
     "senderId": "device_uuid_abc",
     "senderName": "John",
     "receiverId": "ALL",
     "type": "TEXT",
     "content": "Help needed!",
     "timestamp": 1673612345000
   }
   ```

2. **Initial Broadcast**
   - Message sent to all directly connected devices
   - Each device receives and processes

3. **Relay Decision**
   - Device checks if message is new (not seen before)
   - If new: Add to seen list, relay to neighbors
   - If duplicate: Drop message

4. **Duplicate Prevention**
   ```java
   Set<String> seenMessageIds = new HashSet<>();
   
   if (seenMessageIds.contains(message.id)) {
       return; // Already processed
   }
   seenMessageIds.add(message.id);
   relayToNeighbors(message);
   ```

5. **Time-To-Live (TTL)**
   - Messages have hop count limit
   - Prevents infinite loops
   - Default: 10 hops maximum

### Network Topology Examples

#### Star Topology
```
         [Hub]
          ↙ ↓ ↘
    [A]   [B]   [C]
```
- **Single point of failure**: If hub fails, network splits
- **Efficient for small groups**

#### Mesh Topology (Ideal)
```
    [A] ←→ [B]
     ↕  ⤫  ↕
    [C] ←→ [D]
```
- **Redundant paths**: Multiple routes to destination
- **Self-healing**: Network adapts to device failures
- **Scalable**: Supports hundreds of devices

#### Linear Topology
```
[A] ←→ [B] ←→ [C] ←→ [D] ←→ [E]
```
- **Maximum distance**: Each hop extends range
- **Fragile**: Break at any point splits network
- **Common in practice**: People in a line (rescue operations)

### Routing Intelligence

#### Broadcast Messages (Global Chat, SOS)
- Sent to ALL devices in network
- Uses flooding algorithm
- Every device relays once

#### Unicast Messages (Private Chat)
- Destination: Specific device UUID
- Smart routing (future enhancement):
  - Track network topology
  - Find shortest path
  - Reduce hops
